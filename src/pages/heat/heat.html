    <b>HEAT</b></p>
  
    <p align="justify">Before the middle of the nineteenth century, heat was thought to be
    an invisible, weightless substance called <i style="color:blue">caloric</i>. After many
    careful experiments from James Prescott Joule, he noticed that <b style=
    "color:crimson">heat</b> <i style="color:blue">is a form of energy</i>. The SI unit of
    heat is the Joule (J).</p>
  
    <p align="left"><br /></p>
  
    <p align="justify">When two bodies of different temperatures are brought into contact,
    energy flows from the hotter body to the colder body until their temperatures are
    equal. Simply put, heat flows from a region of higher temperature to a region of lower
    temperature.</p>
  
    <p align="left"><br /></p>
  
    <p align="justify"><b style="color:crimson">Sources of heat energy</b><br /></p>
  
    <p align="justify">Since heat is a form of energy, most of our sources of heat are
    examples of energy transformation (conversion of other forms of energy) into heat. The
    most important ones are:</p>
  
    <p align="justify"></p>
  
    <ol>
      <li>Solar energy; heat from the sun.
  
        <p align="justify"></p>
      </li>
  
      <li>Nuclear energy; heat generated from nuclear reactions.
  
        <p align="justify"></p>
      </li>
  
      <li>Geothermal energy; heat within the earth crust, such as molten lava from
      volcanoes.
  
        <p align="justify"></p>
      </li>
  
      <li>Friction; heat generated from resistance against sliding.
  
        <p align="justify"></p>
      </li>
  
      <li>Exothermic chemical reaction; this is the heat generated from chemical reaction.
  
        <p align="justify"></p>
      </li>
  
      <li>Burning of fuels; this is also a form of chemical reaction known as combustion.
  
        <p align="left"><br /></p>
  
        <p align="justify"></p>
      </li>
    </ol><b style="color:crimson">Thermal expansion</b><br />
  
    <p align="justify">With few exceptions, substances (solid, liquid or gases) expand when
    heated and contracts when cooled. When the temperature of substance is raised, its
    thermal energy increases. The increase in thermal energy increases the amplitude of
    vibrations of the atoms or molecules of the substance.</p>
  
    <p align="left"><br /></p>
  
    <p align="justify">As a result, the atoms and molecules move to equilibrium positions
    slightly further apart than before, and the solid expands in all directions. When equal
    volumes of gas, liquid and solid are heated, the gas expands more than the other two
    and the liquid also expands than the solid.</p>
  
    <p align="left"><br /></p>
  
    <p align="justify"><b style="color:crimson">Anomalous Expansion of Water</b><br /></p>
  
    <p align="justify">Most substances expand as they are being heated. Water is an
    exception of this general trend of heating and expansion. When water at a temperature
    below 0<sup>o</sup>C is heated, it expands steadily until it gets to 0<sup>o</sup>C. It
    begins to contract between the temperature ranges from 0<sup>o</sup>C to 4<sup>o</sup>C
    and expands steadily again at temperatures greater than 4<sup>o</sup>C. In that sense,
    water has its highest density at 4<sup>o</sup>C.</p>
  
    <p align="left"><br /></p>
  
    <p align="justify"><b style="color:crimson">Heat Transfer</b></p>
  
    <p align="justify">There are three modes of heat transfer. They are:<br /></p>
  
    <p align="justify"></p>
  
    <ol>
      <li>
        <b style="color:crimson">Conduction</b> is a mode of heat transfer where heat is
        passed on from one particle to the other without any movement of the
        particles.<br />
  
        <p align="justify"></p>
      </li>
  
      <li>
        <b style="color:crimson">Convection</b> is a mode of heat transfer where the heated
        particle of a substance moves to a different position within the substance. This
        mode of heat transfer is found in fluids (liquid and gases). The cooling system of
        an engine, ventilation of room, refrigeration, sea and land breezes works on the
        principle of convection currents.<br />
  
        <p align="justify"></p>
      </li>
  
      <li>
        <b style="color:crimson">Radiation</b> is a mode of heat transfer that does not
        require any material medium.
  
        <p align="left"><br /></p>
  
        <p align="justify"></p>
      </li>
    </ol>The picture below shows the three modes of heat transfer. The water gets heated
    through convection. As the water in contact with the base of the saucepan gets warm it
    expands. When the water expands, its volume increases but its weight remains the same.
  
    <p align="left"><br /></p>
  
    <p align="justify"><img src="http://speedapp.ididev.com/apps/img/heat1.jpg" alt="" width="302" height="200" /></p>
  
    <p align="left"><br /></p>
  
    <p align="justify">Meaning its density has decreased, therefore it rises. Cold water
    replaces the risen warm water. This movement of the water molecules results in uniform
    temperature distribution in the water. The handle of the saucepan gets hot through
    conduction and your hands feel the heat through radiation.</p>
  
    <p align="left"><br /></p>
  
    <p align="justify"><b style="color:crimson">Land and Sea Breezes</b><br /></p>
  
    <p align="justify">During the day, the land gets warmer than the sea. Therefore, the
    air that gets in contact with the ground gets warm and then rises. Cold air from the
    sea comes to land to replace the rising warm air whilst air from the high atmosphere
    comes to replace the cold air that moved to the land. This movement of warm and cold
    air forms <b style="color:crimson">Sea Breeze.</b><br />
    <img src="http://speedapp.ididev.com/apps/img/heat2.jpg" width="392" height="365" alt="" /><br />
    (a) Sea breeze<br /></p>
  
    <p align="justify"><b style="color:crimson">Land Breeze</b> occurs at night. At night,
    the land is not heated by the sun; hence it cools down faster than the sea. The air in
    contact with the sea gets warmer and then rises.</p>
  
    <p align="left"><br />
    <img src="http://speedapp.ididev.com/apps/img/heat3.jpg" alt="" width="412" height="355" /><br />
    (b) Land Breeze<br />
    <br /></p>
  
    <p align="justify">Cold air from the land moves in to take the place of the risen warm
    air whilst air from the high atmosphere replaces the cold air that moved to the sea.
    This movement also forms land breeze.</p>
  
    <p align="left"><br /></p>
  
    <p align="justify"><b style="color:crimson">The Thermos Flask</b><br /></p>
  
    <p align="justify">The thermos flask is designed to maintain the temperature of its
    constituents. Heat losses by all the three modes of heat transfer are reduced to a
    possible minimum level.</p>
  
    <p align="left"><br /></p>
  
    <p align="justify">Heat losses by<br /></p>
  
    <p align="justify"></p>
  
    <ol>
      <li>Radiation is prevented by the silvered surface of the glass, because shiny
      surfaces reflect greater part of the heat it receives.<br />
  
        <p align="justify"></p>
      </li>
  
      <li>Conduction and convection which require a material medium is reduced by the
      vacuum.
  
        <p align="left"><br /></p>
  
        <p align="justify"></p>
      </li>
    </ol>Note that bright surfaces or objects reflects greater amount of radiant heat that
    comes to them than a dark surface. That is why you feel the radiant heat of the sun
    more when you are in a dark shirt than you would when you are in a brighter one.
  
    <p align="left"><br /></p>
  
    <p align="justify"><b style="color: crimson">An Experiment to show that dark surfaces
    absorb radiant heat more than bright surfaces</b></p>
  
    <p align="justify">Candle wax is used to hold two corks to dark and bright metallic
    surfaces respectively so that they adhere. A candle is lighted and placed between the
    two surfaces as shown the in figureS below.<br />
    <img alt="" src="http://speedapp.ididev.com/apps/img/heat4.png" /> <img alt="" src="http://speedapp.ididev.com/apps/img/heat5.png" /><br />
    <br />
    (a). The distance between the lighted candle and the two surfaces must be equal. The
    cork on the dark surface falls first because the dark surface absorbs radiant heat
    better and causes the wax to melt.</p>
